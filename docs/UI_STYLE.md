# UI Style Guide

The visual language is "fantasy-luxury": rich materials, gilded accents, and editorial typography. The UI should feel like a high-end campaign atlas rather than a utilitarian tool.

## Themes

- Warm parchment backgrounds with subtle gradients or texture overlays.
- Gilded accents (`--gold`) for calls to action and highlights.
- Velvet accents (`--velvet`) for primary buttons and headers.

## Typography

- Title font: decorative serif (Cinzel or similar).
- Body font: readable serif (Source Serif 4 or similar).
- UI font: clean sans (Manrope or similar) for labels and metadata.

## Motion

- Staggered entrance for dashboard panels on load.
- Soft glow on active cards or hovered navigation.

## UI Components

- Panels: rounded, softly elevated, with warm highlights.
- Tags: pill-shaped, uppercase, tactical cues.
- Logs: cinematic transcript styling with clear timestamps.
